# General Description:
GeoLance is Georgian Freelancing website, it is my biggest project i've ever done


# Code Description:
Code was not considered to be open-source so it is not easly readable, and some part of it is also wirtten in Georgian langauge too(like variable names) , but i can explain every line if needed for interview

Unlike my second project GeorgianBase , This project was built about 1 year ago so i've improved many things since, it also doesn't support responsive design for mobile.
